# AI-Assisted Code Modification Request

### File(s) to Modify:
# CRITICAL: Provide the exact, relative path to the file you want to change.
- [config/settings.py]

### Type of Change:
# Choose one: Refactor / Style / Variable Rename / Logic Adjustment / Frontend Tweak / Bug Fix
- [Bug Fix]

### Goal:
# A clear, one-sentence description of the desired outcome.
- [Correct the DATABASES setting to properly use the DATABASE_URL from the .env file, instead of a hardcoded name.]

---

### Detailed Instructions:

# The application is failing because the DATABASES setting is using a hardcoded
# database name ('mydatabase') instead of parsing the DATABASE_URL from the environment.

# FIND:
# ```python
# # Find the hardcoded DATABASES dictionary. The AI might have generated
# # something similar to this, with 'NAME': 'mydatabase'.
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'user',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
# ```
#
# REPLACE WITH:
# ```python
# # Replace it with the correct django-environ pattern that reads the DATABASE_URL.
# # This makes the entire configuration dynamic and secure.
DATABASES = {
    'default': env.db('DATABASE_URL', default='postgresql://user:password@localhost/verifast')
}
# ```

### Scope and Boundaries (Safety Rules):

# These rules protect your codebase. Do not change them.
- Only modify the file(s) listed above. Do NOT touch any other files.
- Do not change any function names, arguments, or return types unless explicitly instructed to do so in this document.
- Do not add any new third-party libraries or dependencies.
- Preserve the existing code style and formatting.

---

### Validation Steps:

# The command 'python manage.py check' will validate that the Django settings are correct
# and that a connection to the 'verifast' database can now be established.

- Command: `python manage.py check`
