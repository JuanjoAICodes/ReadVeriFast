# Diagnostic Report: Django TemplateSyntaxError

## ðŸŽ‰ STATUS: RESOLVED âœ…

**Resolution Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Resolution Details**: See `TEMPLATE_SYNTAX_FIXES_APPLIED.md` for complete fix documentation

## 1. Executive Summary

~~This report details the root cause of the `TemplateSyntaxError` occurring on the article detail page. The primary issue is a minor but critical syntax error in the Django template language, specifically an incorrect use of whitespace within a template filter.~~

**UPDATE**: All issues identified in this diagnostic have been successfully resolved. The Django application now passes all template validation checks and system checks without errors.

~~Additionally, this report identifies several potential underlying issues in the template and associated JavaScript code that are likely to cause bugs or unexpected behavior even after the primary syntax error is resolved. These include potential `AttributeError` exceptions for anonymous users, JavaScript type coercion problems, and suboptimal patterns for passing data from Django to JavaScript.~~

**UPDATE**: All secondary issues have also been resolved with improved patterns for user authentication handling, JavaScript type consistency, and modern data-passing approaches.

## 2. Primary Issue: `TemplateSyntaxError`

### Symptom

The application crashes when rendering the article detail page (`/en/articles/14/`) with the following error:

```
TemplateSyntaxError: default requires 2 arguments, 1 provided
```

This error originates in the template file `verifast_app/templates/verifast_app/article_detail.html` at lines 497 and 503.

### Root Cause

The Django template parser is strict about its syntax, particularly regarding whitespace around filter arguments. The error is caused by an extra space between the colon (`:`) and the argument for the `default` filter.

-   **Incorrect Syntax Used:** `{{ user.current_wpm |default: "250" }}`
-   **Correct Syntax:** `{{ user.current_wpm|default:"250" }}`

The space causes the parser to misinterpret `"250"` as a separate, invalid argument, leading to the `TemplateSyntaxError`. This mistake is present in two locations in the file.

## 3. Potential Secondary Issues

The following issues were identified during the analysis and may lead to further errors or unexpected behavior.

### Potential Issue 1: `AttributeError` for Anonymous Users

-   **Symptom:** After fixing the syntax, the page may still raise an `AttributeError` for users who are not logged in.
-   **Analysis:** The request information shows the current user is `AnonymousUser`. The template attempts to access `user.current_wpm`. The `AnonymousUser` object does not have a `current_wpm` attribute, and accessing it will raise an `AttributeError`. The `default` filter only works if the variable exists but is `False`, `None`, or an empty string; it does not prevent `AttributeError`.
-   **Recommendation:** Wrap the logic that accesses user-specific attributes in a check to ensure the user is authenticated.
    ```django
    {% if user.is_authenticated %}
        window.userWpm = {{ user.current_wpm|default:250 }};
    {% else %}
        window.userWpm = 250; // Default for anonymous users
    {% endif %}
    ```

### Potential Issue 2: JavaScript Type Inconsistency

-   **Symptom:** The speed adjustment feature in the UI might behave incorrectly. For example, instead of adding `50` to the current speed, it might concatenate strings (e.g., `"250" + 50` becoming `"25050"`).
-   **Analysis:** The template code `|default:"250"` provides a **string**. If `user.current_wpm` is an integer, the type of `window.userWpm` will be inconsistent depending on whether the user has a WPM value set or not. The JavaScript code `this.currentWpm + delta` will perform string concatenation if `this.currentWpm` is a string.
-   **Recommendation:**
    1.  Provide a number directly from the template by removing the quotes: `|default:250`.
    2.  Alternatively, explicitly parse the value as an integer in the JavaScript code: `this.currentWpm = parseInt(this.currentWpm, 10) + delta;`.

### Potential Issue 3: Suboptimal Data-to-JavaScript Passing

-   **Symptom:** The code becomes harder to maintain, debug, and scale. Placing server-rendered data into the global JavaScript `window` object can lead to naming conflicts and makes it difficult to track where data is coming from.
-   **Analysis:** The template injects `article.id` and `user.current_wpm` directly into global JavaScript variables. A more robust and modern approach is to use `data-*` attributes on the relevant HTML elements.
-   **Recommendation:** Attach the data to the HTML element that the JavaScript will interact with.
    ```html
    <!-- In the template -->
    <div id="speed-reader-component"
         x-data="speedReader"
         data-article-id="{{ article.id }}"
         data-initial-wpm="{{ user.current_wpm|default:250 }}">
         ...
    </div>

    <!-- In JavaScript -->
    <script>
    document.addEventListener('alpine:init', () => {
        Alpine.data('speedReader', () => ({
            //...
            // Read the value from the data attribute during initialization
            currentWpm: parseInt(this.$el.dataset.initialWpm, 10),
            //...
        }));
    });
    </script>
    ```
