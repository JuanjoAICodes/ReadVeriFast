# Tag System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive tag-based content discovery system for VeriFast. The system leverages Wikipedia-validated tags to create meaningful content categorization, allowing users to explore articles by topic with integrated speed reading and quiz functionality for both regular articles and Wikipedia content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Wikipedia-Validated Tag System

**User Story:** As a content curator, I want tags to be validated against Wikipedia, so that only meaningful and well-defined topics become tags in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tag is created THEN the system SHALL verify it has a corresponding Wikipedia article
2. WHEN a tag lacks a Wikipedia article THEN the system SHALL reject it as not important enough
3. WHEN displaying tags THEN the system SHALL show only Wikipedia-validated tags
4. WHEN a tag is validated THEN the system SHALL store the Wikipedia URL for reference
5. WHEN tags are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain the Wikipedia article content for speed reading

### Requirement 2: Tag Search and Discovery Page

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for tags and articles, so that I can discover content by topic and find articles with multiple related tags.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the tag search page THEN the system SHALL display a search interface
2. WHEN searching for tags THEN the system SHALL show matching tag names and descriptions
3. WHEN searching for articles THEN the system SHALL show articles containing the search terms
4. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support finding articles with multiple specific tags
5. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL show tag statistics (article count)

### Requirement 3: Individual Tag Detail Pages

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all articles related to a specific tag, so that I can explore content within a topic area with the Wikipedia article prominently featured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a tag page THEN the system SHALL display the Wikipedia article first and larger
2. WHEN viewing a tag page THEN the system SHALL list all other articles with that tag below
3. WHEN clicking the Wikipedia article THEN the system SHALL open it in VeriFast article view
4. WHEN viewing tag articles THEN the system SHALL show article metadata (date, source, reading time)
5. WHEN no articles exist for a tag THEN the system SHALL show only the Wikipedia article

### Requirement 4: Wikipedia Article Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to speed read Wikipedia articles with quizzes, so that I can learn about topics using the same VeriFast experience as regular articles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking a Wikipedia article THEN the system SHALL display it in standard article detail view
2. WHEN reading Wikipedia articles THEN the system SHALL provide speed reader functionality
3. WHEN completing Wikipedia articles THEN the system SHALL generate AI quizzes about the content
4. WHEN taking Wikipedia quizzes THEN the system SHALL award XP using the same formula
5. WHEN Wikipedia content is processed THEN the system SHALL extract and clean the text appropriately

### Requirement 5: Tag Navigation and Linking

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between related tags and articles, so that I can explore interconnected topics seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing article detail pages THEN tag links SHALL navigate to tag detail pages
2. WHEN viewing tag pages THEN the system SHALL show related tags (tags that appear together)
3. WHEN browsing tags THEN the system SHALL provide breadcrumb navigation
4. WHEN on tag pages THEN the system SHALL show tag hierarchy or relationships
5. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL maintain user context and reading progress

### Requirement 6: Tag Statistics and Analytics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see tag popularity and statistics, so that I can understand which topics have the most content and engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing tag lists THEN the system SHALL show article count for each tag
2. WHEN viewing tag pages THEN the system SHALL display tag statistics (total articles, recent additions)
3. WHEN browsing tags THEN the system SHALL show popular/trending tags
4. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL show user engagement metrics (quiz completion rates)
5. WHEN displaying analytics THEN the system SHALL respect user privacy and aggregate data appropriately

## Technical Requirements

### Wikipedia Integration
- **WI-001:** System SHALL use Wikipedia API to validate tag existence
- **WI-002:** System SHALL cache Wikipedia article content for offline access
- **WI-003:** System SHALL process Wikipedia content through the same NLP pipeline as regular articles
- **WI-004:** System SHALL generate quizzes for Wikipedia articles using the same AI system

### Search Functionality
- **SF-001:** Search SHALL support full-text search across tag names and descriptions
- **SF-002:** Search SHALL support filtering by multiple tags simultaneously
- **SF-003:** Search results SHALL be paginated for performance
- **SF-004:** Search SHALL provide autocomplete suggestions for tag names

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001:** Tag pages SHALL load within 2 seconds
- **PR-002:** Search results SHALL appear within 1 second
- **PR-003:** Wikipedia content SHALL be cached to avoid repeated API calls
- **PR-004:** Tag statistics SHALL be cached and updated periodically

## Data Model Requirements

### Tag Model Extensions
```python
class Tag(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)
    wikipedia_url = models.URLField(null=True, blank=True)
    wikipedia_content = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
    description = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
    article_count = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    last_updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    is_validated = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

### URL Structure
- `/tags/` - Tag search and discovery page
- `/tags/<slug:tag_name>/` - Individual tag detail page
- `/tags/search/?q=<query>` - Tag search results
- `/articles/wikipedia/<slug:tag_name>/` - Wikipedia article view

## Business Rules

### Tag Validation Process
1. **Tag Creation:** Only create tags that have corresponding Wikipedia articles
2. **Content Processing:** Wikipedia articles go through the same processing pipeline
3. **Quiz Generation:** Wikipedia articles get AI-generated quizzes
4. **XP Rewards:** Wikipedia quiz completion awards XP using standard formula

### Search Behavior
1. **Tag Search:** Prioritize exact matches, then partial matches
2. **Multi-tag Search:** Support AND/OR logic for multiple tags
3. **Article Search:** Search across title, content, and associated tags
4. **Result Ranking:** Rank by relevance, recency, and user engagement

### Navigation Flow
1. **Article → Tag:** Clicking tags on articles navigates to tag pages
2. **Tag → Wikipedia:** Wikipedia article is prominently featured and clickable
3. **Tag → Articles:** Other articles are listed with standard metadata
4. **Search → Results:** Search leads to filtered results with clear navigation
