## Task Execution Notes

### Debugging Approach
1. **Start with browser developer tools** to identify JavaScript errors and network failures
2. **Check Django logs** for backend errors and missing context data
3. **Verify database content** to ensure articles have content and quiz data
4. **Test individual components** before testing integrated workflows

### Priority Order
1. **Article content display** - Foundation for all other features
2. **Speed reader functionality** - Core reading feature
3. **Quiz system** - Required for XP earning and commenting unlock
4. **Comment system** - Social interaction feature
5. **Premium features** - Monetization and advanced functionality
6. **Tag display** - Content organization feature

### Testing Strategy
- Test each fix individually before moving to the next task
- Use both authenticated and anonymous user accounts for testing
- Test with articles that have different content types (short, long, with/without quiz data)
- Verify XP balances and transactions after each operation
