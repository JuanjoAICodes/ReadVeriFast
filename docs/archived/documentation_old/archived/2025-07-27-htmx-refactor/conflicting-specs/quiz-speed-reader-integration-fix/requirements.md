# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical frontend integration issue where clicking the quiz button causes the speed reader to disappear and the quiz functionality to fail. The current implementation incorrectly hides the entire speed reader section when starting a quiz, breaking the user experience and preventing proper quiz functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the speed reader to remain visible when I start a quiz, so that I can still access reading functionality while taking the quiz.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Start Quiz" button THEN the speed reader section SHALL remain visible- when the quiz start it should be like the speed reader and take center 


2. WHEN the quiz modal opens THEN the speed reader SHALL still be accessible in the background  
no need to be in the backgroud just back when the quiz has been finished

3. WHEN I close the quiz modal THEN the speed reader SHALL function normally
4. WHEN both features are present THEN they SHALL coexist without interfering with each other

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the quiz to display properly in a modal overlay, so that I can take the quiz without losing access to the article content. 
the article is only available in the speed reader or the link to the original article 

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Start Quiz" THEN a modal overlay SHALL appear over the article content  
the article is only available in the speed reader or the link to the original article 
2. WHEN the quiz modal is open THEN the background SHALL be dimmed but still visible
3. WHEN I complete or close the quiz THEN the modal SHALL disappear cleanly
4. WHEN the modal is active THEN it SHALL prevent interaction with background elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling for quiz functionality, so that I get clear feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quiz data is missing THEN I SHALL see a clear error message
2. WHEN the quiz fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide helpful feedback
3. WHEN there are JavaScript errors THEN they SHALL not break the entire page
4. WHEN the quiz submission fails THEN I SHALL be notified and able to retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the quiz and speed reader to work independently, so that I can use either feature without affecting the other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the speed reader THEN it SHALL not interfere with quiz functionality
2. WHEN I take a quiz THEN it SHALL not break the speed reader
3. WHEN I switch between features THEN both SHALL maintain their state properly
4. WHEN both features are loaded THEN they SHALL share resources efficiently
