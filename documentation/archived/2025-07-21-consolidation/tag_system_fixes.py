ARCHIVED: Comprehensive Tag System Fixes
Original Location: /tag_system_fixes.py
Archive Date: July 21, 2025
Archive Reason: Temporary fix script - functionality has been implemented directly in codebase

This script was created to fix Tag System issues but is no longer needed as the fixes
have been applied directly to the codebase during the Tag System implementation.

Original functionality:
- Migration conflict fixes
- Enhanced TagAdmin creation  
- Comprehensive test suite creation
- Performance optimization recommendations

Status: All fixes have been implemented and are part of the main codebase.
