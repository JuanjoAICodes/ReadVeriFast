# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update speed display format to show current/max WPM
  - Modify the speed display HTML to show format "current/max" (e.g., "200/400 WPM")
  - Update JavaScript to dynamically update the current speed number when WPM slider changes
  - Ensure max speed shows user's personal max WPM for authenticated users, 1000 for anonymous
  - Test display formatting and real-time updates
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Create immersive overlay HTML structure and CSS
  - Add CSS classes for immersive overlay with full-screen positioning
  - Create dark background overlay with 90% opacity
  - Style immersive word display with larger font size and center positioning
  - Add CSS transitions for smooth animations between modes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 3. Implement overlay creation and management JavaScript
  - Write function to create immersive overlay DOM element
  - Implement overlay positioning and z-index management
  - Add function to destroy overlay and clean up event listeners
  - Create state management for tracking immersive mode status
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Add smooth transition animations for entering immersive mode
  - Implement "jump forward" animation for speed reader rectangle expansion
  - Add fade effect for background elements to secondary focus
  - Create smooth scaling and positioning transitions for word display
  - Optimize animation timing and easing for professional feel
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 1.3_

- [x] 5. Implement single stop button control system
  - Create stop button with prominent styling in immersive mode
  - Hide WPM slider and secondary controls when in immersive mode
  - Add event handler for stop button to pause reading and exit immersive mode
  - Ensure proper state preservation when exiting immersive mode
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 6. Integrate immersive mode with existing speed reader functionality
  - Modify existing start button to trigger immersive mode activation
  - Ensure reading progress and word position are preserved across mode transitions
  - Update existing pause/resume logic to work with immersive overlay
  - Test compatibility with existing quiz system and other page features
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 1.4_

- [x] 7. Add responsive design support for different screen sizes
  - Implement mobile-specific styling for smaller screens
  - Add media queries for optimal font sizes across devices
  - Handle orientation changes and screen size variations
  - Test immersive mode on various devices and screen resolutions
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 8. Implement keyboard accessibility and navigation
  - Add keyboard shortcuts for entering and exiting immersive mode
  - Ensure stop button is keyboard accessible with proper focus management
  - Add ARIA labels and screen reader support for immersive elements
  - Test keyboard navigation throughout the immersive experience
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 5.4_

- [x] 9. Add error handling and browser compatibility
  - Implement graceful degradation for browsers without CSS transform support
  - Add error handling for overlay creation failures
  - Handle edge cases like rapid mode switching and animation interruption
  - Test across different browsers and ensure consistent functionality
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 1.4_

- [x] 10. Optimize performance and add final polish
  - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
  - Implement efficient DOM manipulation to minimize reflows
  - Add proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Fine-tune animation timing and visual effects for professional appearance
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.1, 4.2_
