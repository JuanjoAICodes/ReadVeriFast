# HTMX Hybrid Architecture Refactor Documentation Archive

**Archive Date:** July 27, 2025  
**Archive Reason:** Documentation moved to implementation spec  
**Replacement Location:** `.kiro/specs/htmx-hybrid-architecture/`

## Archived Files

### Documentation Files (Superseded by Spec)
- `speed-reader-quiz-refactor.md` - Old architecture documentation
- `speed-reader-quiz-endpoints.md` - Old API documentation  
- `quiz-system.md` - Old quiz system documentation
- `speed-reader-system.md` - Old speed reader documentation
- `verifast-frontend-architecture.md` - Old frontend architecture guide
- `speed-reader.md` - Old JavaScript-heavy speed reader feature docs
- `speed-reader-debugging-guide.md` - Old JavaScript debugging guide
- `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` - Old JavaScript-based architecture guide

### Conflicting Specs (Replaced by HTMX Implementation)
- `conflicting-specs/quiz-speed-reader-integration-fix/` - JavaScript-based integration fix
- `conflicting-specs/immersive-speed-reader/` - JavaScript-heavy immersive mode
- `conflicting-specs/core-functionality-fixes/` - JavaScript-focused functionality fixes

These files contained JavaScript-heavy approaches that conflict with the new HTMX hybrid architecture.

## Context

The HTMX hybrid architecture refactor represents a major architectural change from JavaScript-heavy to server-side dominant approach with minimal client-side code. The documentation was initially created as standalone files but has been consolidated into a proper implementation spec.

## Current Status

- **Requirements:** Completed in spec
- **Design:** Completed in spec  
- **Implementation Tasks:** In progress
- **Documentation:** Moved to spec format
