# Documentation Consolidation Requirements

## Introduction

The VeriFast project currently has documentation scattered across multiple locations with conflicting, outdated, and confusing information. This creates barriers for developers trying to understand and work with the codebase. We need to consolidate, clean up, and standardize all documentation to follow Kiro documentation standards while preserving historical information by moving outdated content to appropriate archive locations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Documentation Audit and Classification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily identify which documentation is current and accurate, so that I can quickly understand the project status and architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing project documentation THEN the system SHALL categorize all documentation files into current, outdated, or conflicting categories
2. WHEN documentation conflicts are identified THEN the system SHALL document the specific contradictions and their locations
3. WHEN outdated documentation is found THEN the system SHALL identify what makes it outdated (code changes, feature removals, etc.)
4. WHEN documentation is scattered across locations THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive inventory of all documentation files and their purposes

### Requirement 2: Documentation Archival System

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want outdated documentation preserved but moved out of the way, so that historical context is maintained without confusing current developers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN outdated documentation is identified THEN the system SHALL move it to appropriate archive directories
2. WHEN moving documentation THEN the system SHALL maintain clear naming conventions that indicate why it was archived
3. WHEN archiving documentation THEN the system SHALL create redirect notes in the original locations pointing to current information
4. WHEN documentation is archived THEN the system SHALL preserve the original file structure and timestamps

### Requirement 3: Documentation Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all current documentation to follow consistent Kiro standards, so that I can efficiently navigate and understand project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating documentation THEN the system SHALL follow Kiro documentation formatting standards
2. WHEN creating documentation structure THEN the system SHALL use consistent file naming conventions
3. WHEN organizing documentation THEN the system SHALL create a logical hierarchy that matches project structure
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL ensure cross-references and links are accurate and functional

### Requirement 4: Centralized Documentation Hub

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want a single entry point to understand the project structure and find relevant documentation, so that I can quickly get up to speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing project documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a main README that serves as the documentation hub
2. WHEN navigating documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear paths to different types of information (setup, architecture, features, etc.)
3. WHEN looking for specific information THEN the system SHALL provide a documentation index or table of contents
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain the central hub with current links and descriptions

### Requirement 5: Code-Documentation Alignment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation to accurately reflect the current codebase, so that I can trust the documentation when making changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing feature documentation THEN the system SHALL ensure it matches the actual implemented functionality
2. WHEN API documentation exists THEN the system SHALL verify it matches current API endpoints and responses
3. WHEN setup instructions are provided THEN the system SHALL verify they work with the current codebase
4. WHEN architecture documentation exists THEN the system SHALL ensure it reflects the current project structure and dependencies

### Requirement 6: Documentation Maintenance Guidelines

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want clear guidelines for keeping documentation current, so that documentation quality is maintained over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation standards are established THEN the system SHALL create maintenance guidelines for future updates
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL provide checklists for related documentation updates
3. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL provide templates for consistent documentation
4. WHEN documentation becomes outdated THEN the system SHALL provide processes for identification and remediation
