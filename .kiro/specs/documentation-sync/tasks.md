  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 9.1, 9.2_

- [x] 6. Correct Database and Migration Status
  - Update all references from "5 migrations" to "8 migrations applied"
  - Add evidence of actual migration files (0006, 0007, 0008)
  - Update Technical-Specification.md with current database schema
  - Reference actual XPTransaction and FeaturePurchase models
  - _Requirements: 6.3, 7.2, 7.3, 10.3_

- [x] 7. Synchronize API Backend Status Documentation
  - Ensure consistent "98% complete" across all files
  - Update API-Ready-Backend-Specification.md status
  - Add evidence of actual API endpoints and serializers
  - Remove conflicting API status claims from other documents
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 7.1_

- [x] 8. Fix Session Summary Inaccuracies and Move to Historical Records
  - Move Session-Summary-July-18-2025.md to sessions/ subfolder
  - Correct it to show XP Economics was "discovered complete" not "planned"
  - Update task completion status from "ready to start" to "found already implemented"
  - Mark as historical record, not current status source
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3_

- [x] 9. Add Evidence References to All Feature Claims
  - Add code file references for all implemented features in PROJECT-STATUS.md
  - Link XP system claims to actual xp_system.py (1750+ lines)
  - Reference specific model fields in CustomUser model
  - Add migration file references for database changes
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [x] 10. Update Implementation Task Statuses
  - Mark all 12 Enhanced XP Economics tasks as complete in PROJECT-STATUS.md
  - Update task tracking to show implementation discovery vs planning
  - Remove "ready for implementation" language where features exist
  - Add completion evidence for all claimed tasks
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 8.3, 9.3_

- [x] 11. Standardize Feature Status Language and Kiro Standards
  - Use consistent terminology for completed features across all files
  - Replace "ready to implement" with "fully implemented" where appropriate
  - Ensure premium features are marked as complete with evidence
  - Apply Kiro documentation standards for formatting and structure
  - _Requirements: 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 9.2_

- [x] 12. Verify and Update Technical Specifications
  - Update Technical-Specification.md with actual implemented models
  - Correct architecture diagrams to reflect current implementation
  - Add XP transaction system to technical architecture
  - Update data model documentation with premium feature fields
  - _Requirements: 9.3, 9.4, 7.4_

- [x] 13. Create Documentation Accuracy Verification
  - Cross-reference all completion percentages across files
  - Verify all code references point to existing files
  - Test all claimed API endpoints for functionality
  - Validate all model field claims against actual database schema
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 14. Final Consistency Review and Quality Assurance
  - Review all updated documentation for internal consistency
  - Ensure no contradictory statements remain between files
  - Verify audit findings are prominently displayed in PROJECT-STATUS.md
  - Confirm all critical discrepancies have been addressed
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

## Task Dependencies

**Sequential Dependencies:**
- Task 1 (Audit Findings) should be completed first to establish context
- Tasks 2-5 (Status Corrections) can be done in parallel
- Task 11 (Verification) should be done after all content updates
- Task 12 (Final Review) must be last

**Content Dependencies:**
- Tasks 2, 6, 8 all relate to Enhanced XP Economics corrections
- Tasks 3, 4, 5 all involve completion percentage updates
- Tasks 7, 10 both involve technical evidence integration

## Verification Criteria

Each task is complete when:
1. **Accuracy**: All claims match actual codebase implementation
2. **Evidence**: All claims are backed by specific code references
3. **Consistency**: Status is consistent across all documentation files
4. **Clarity**: Audit findings clearly explain what was corrected and why

## Quality Gates

**Before Starting:**
- [ ] Code audit findings documented and verified
- [ ] List of all files requiring updates identified
- [ ] Evidence collection from codebase completed

**During Implementation:**
- [ ] Each file update includes evidence references
- [ ] No new inconsistencies introduced between files
- [ ] All critical discrepancies addressed

**After Completion:**
- [ ] All completion percentages consistent across files
- [ ] No documentation claims contradict actual code
- [ ] Audit trail complete and prominently displayed
- [ ] New developers can understand actual project status

## Success Metrics

**Accuracy Metrics:**
- 0 critical discrepancies between documentation and code
- 100% of feature claims backed by code evidence
- Consistent completion percentages across all files

**Usability Metrics:**
- Documentation accurately represents project for new developers
- Stakeholders have correct completion information
- Technical reviewers can verify all claims against codebase
