## Requirement 1: Fix Critical Code Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all critical errors identified during the project audit, so that the application is stable and runs without crashing.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application is run THEN it SHALL NOT crash due to "undefined name" errors.
2. WHEN the application is run THEN it SHALL NOT crash due to "attribute not found" errors.
3. WHEN the linter is run THEN it SHALL NOT report any critical errors.
