# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical need to audit, consolidate, and document the current state of the VeriFast project. The project has undergone numerous changes documented in various markdown files, plus potentially undocumented code changes. We need a comprehensive audit to understand exactly where the project stands in its implementation lifecycle and create a single, authoritative set of documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a complete audit of all existing code and documentation, so that I can understand the current implementation status and identify gaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit is performed THEN the system SHALL catalog all existing Django models, views, templates, and functionality
2. WHEN the audit is performed THEN the system SHALL identify all markdown documentation files and their purposes
3. WHEN the audit is performed THEN the system SHALL compare actual code implementation against the original PRD requirements
4. WHEN the audit is performed THEN the system SHALL document any undocumented changes or deviations from the original plan

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all scattered documentation consolidated into a single authoritative source, so that future development can proceed with clear guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is consolidated THEN the system SHALL create a unified requirements document
2. WHEN documentation is consolidated THEN the system SHALL create a unified technical specification
3. WHEN documentation is consolidated THEN the system SHALL create a current implementation status report
4. WHEN documentation is consolidated THEN the system SHALL identify which BuildVerifast.md stages have been completed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to understand the current database schema and model relationships, so that I can plan future changes effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database audit is performed THEN the system SHALL document all existing models and their fields
2. WHEN the database audit is performed THEN the system SHALL document all relationships between models
3. WHEN the database audit is performed THEN the system SHALL identify any migrations that have been applied
4. WHEN the database audit is performed THEN the system SHALL compare current schema against PRD specifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to understand what functionality is currently working versus what needs to be implemented, so that I can prioritize future development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the functionality audit is performed THEN the system SHALL test all existing views and endpoints
2. WHEN the functionality audit is performed THEN the system SHALL document all working features
3. WHEN the functionality audit is performed THEN the system SHALL identify broken or incomplete features
4. WHEN the functionality audit is performed THEN the system SHALL map current functionality against PRD requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a clear roadmap of what needs to be done next, so that development can continue efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a prioritized list of missing features
2. WHEN the audit is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a list of bugs or issues that need fixing
3. WHEN the audit is complete THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for next steps
4. WHEN the audit is complete THEN the system SHALL update the implementation plan based on current state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all configuration and environment setup documented, so that the project can be easily deployed and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is audited THEN the system SHALL document all environment variables and settings
2. WHEN configuration is audited THEN the system SHALL document all dependencies and their versions
3. WHEN configuration is audited THEN the system SHALL document the deployment setup (Procfile, etc.)
4. WHEN configuration is audited THEN the system SHALL verify all configuration matches best practices
