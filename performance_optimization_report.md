python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py compress
```

### 3. Database Optimization
```sql
-- Ensure proper indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_article_processing_status ON verifast_app_article(processing_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_quiz_attempt_user_article ON verifast_app_quizattempt(user_id, article_id);
```

### 4. Monitoring Setup
