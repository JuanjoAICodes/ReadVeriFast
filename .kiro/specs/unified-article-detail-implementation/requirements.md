# Requirements Document - Unified Article Detail Implementation

## Introduction

This specification unifies the speed reader single-mode architecture with the complete article detail page requirements to create a comprehensive, production-ready article detail experience that follows HTMX hybrid architecture principles while providing an immersive speed reading interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Article Detail Page Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view comprehensive article information including metadata, tags, and related content, so that I can understand the full context of the article.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits an article detail page THEN the system SHALL display a complete article header with title, image, source, publication date, reading level, word count, language indicator, and article type
2. WHEN article metadata is missing THEN the system SHALL calculate word count and reading level automatically and save them to the database
3. WHEN an article has tags THEN the system SHALL display all tags as clickable links that navigate to tag detail pages
4. WHEN an article has no tags THEN the system SHALL display a "No tags available" message
5. WHEN related articles exist THEN the system SHALL display up to 6 related articles based on shared tags in a responsive grid layout

### Requirement 2: Single Immersive Mode Speed Reader

**User Story:** As a user, I want to experience immersive speed reading with a full-screen interface, so that I can focus completely on the content without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Start Reading" THEN the system SHALL launch a full-screen immersive overlay with a side-to-side white text strip
2. WHEN the immersive mode is active THEN the system SHALL display words sequentially in a 4rem font size on a white background with black text
3. WHEN a user wants to control reading speed THEN the system SHALL provide speed adjustment controls with a range of 50-1000 WPM
4. WHEN a user wants to pause/resume reading THEN the system SHALL provide toggle controls with visual feedback
5. WHEN a user wants to exit THEN the system SHALL provide an exit button and Escape key functionality that returns to the article page
6. WHEN reading is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically unlock the quiz section

### Requirement 3: HTMX Hybrid Architecture Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the speed reader to follow HTMX hybrid architecture principles, so that business logic remains on the server while maintaining minimal client-side JavaScript.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN speed reader initialization is requested THEN the system SHALL process content on the server with user power-ups and return processed word chunks via HTMX endpoint
2. WHEN reading is completed THEN the system SHALL handle completion via HTMX POST request to award XP and unlock quiz
3. WHEN Alpine.js components are used THEN each component SHALL be under 30 lines and focus only on UI state management
4. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation with basic functionality
5. WHEN server-side processing is required THEN the system SHALL handle all business logic in Django views and services

### Requirement 4: Quiz System Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to take a comprehension quiz after reading, so that I can test my understanding and earn XP rewards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes speed reading THEN the system SHALL unlock the quiz interface via HTMX
2. WHEN quiz data exists for an article THEN the system SHALL display the quiz interface with proper HTMX endpoints
3. WHEN quiz data is missing THEN the system SHALL display a "Quiz is being generated" message
4. WHEN a user submits quiz answers THEN the system SHALL process results on the server and award appropriate XP
5. WHEN a user achieves a passing score (≥70%) THEN the system SHALL unlock commenting functionality

### Requirement 5: Social Features and Comments

**User Story:** As a user, I want to comment on articles and interact with other users' comments, so that I can engage in discussions about the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has completed the quiz with passing score THEN the system SHALL display the comment form with XP cost indicator
2. WHEN a user has not passed the quiz THEN the system SHALL display a locked message explaining the requirement
3. WHEN authenticated users view comments THEN the system SHALL display Bronze/Silver/Gold interaction buttons with XP costs
4. WHEN comment interactions are made THEN the system SHALL process them via HTMX and update XP balances
5. WHEN comments have replies THEN the system SHALL display them in a threaded format

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the article detail page to work properly on mobile and desktop, so that I can access content regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout with responsive grid systems and appropriate font sizes
2. WHEN the immersive speed reader is used on mobile THEN the system SHALL adjust font size to 2.5rem and optimize touch controls
3. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
4. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL support Tab navigation and keyboard shortcuts (Space for play/pause, Escape for exit)
5. WHEN high contrast mode is preferred THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced contrast styling

### Requirement 7: Performance and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the article detail page to load quickly and handle errors gracefully, so that I have a smooth reading experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN immersive mode is activated THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms
2. WHEN word display updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance (≤16ms per update)
3. WHEN content loading fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with retry options
4. WHEN JavaScript is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback content display
5. WHEN memory usage occurs during long reading sessions THEN the system SHALL prevent memory leaks with proper cleanup

### Requirement 8: Data Integration and Calculations

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see accurate article statistics and metadata, so that I can make informed decisions about reading the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN word count is missing THEN the system SHALL calculate it using regex pattern matching and save to database
2. WHEN reading level is missing THEN the system SHALL calculate it using Flesch-Kincaid formula and save to database
3. WHEN user reading speed is available THEN the system SHALL use it for speed reader initialization
4. WHEN anonymous users access the system THEN the system SHALL provide default values (250 WPM) without errors
5. WHEN related articles are requested THEN the system SHALL find articles with shared tags using optimized database queries
