# AI-Assisted Code Modification Request

### File(s) to Modify:
# CRITICAL: Provide the exact, relative path to the file you want to change.
- [config/settings.py]

### Type of Change:
# Choose one: Refactor / Style / Variable Rename / Logic Adjustment / Frontend Tweak / Bug Fix

### Goal:
# A clear, one-sentence description of the desired outcome.
- [Configure the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting to permit local development connections.]

---

### Detailed Instructions:

# The application is failing to start because ALLOWED_HOSTS is empty while DEBUG is False.
# We need to add our local development hosts to this list.

# FIND:
# ```python
# # Find the empty ALLOWED_HOSTS list
ALLOWED_HOSTS = []
# ```
#
# REPLACE WITH:
# ```python
# # Replace it with a list containing our local development hosts
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost']
# ```

---

### Scope and Boundaries (Safety Rules):

# These rules protect your codebase. Do not change them.
- Only modify the file(s) listed above. Do NOT touch any other files.
- Do not change any function names, arguments, or return types unless explicitly instructed to do so in this document.
- Do not add any new third-party libraries or dependencies.
- Preserve the existing code style and formatting.

### Validation Steps:

# The command 'python manage.py check' is the best way to validate Django settings.
# If this command passes, the runserver command will also work.

- Command: `python manage.py check`
