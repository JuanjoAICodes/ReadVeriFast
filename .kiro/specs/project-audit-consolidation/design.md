# Design Document

## Overview

The project audit and consolidation system will systematically analyze the current VeriFast codebase, compare it against the original specifications, and produce a comprehensive set of consolidated documentation. This process will involve automated code analysis, manual review of documentation files, and creation of authoritative documentation that reflects the current state of the project.

## Architecture

The audit process will be structured in phases:

1. **Discovery Phase**: Scan and catalog all existing files, code, and documentation
2. **Analysis Phase**: Analyze code functionality, database schema, and compare against specifications
3. **Consolidation Phase**: Create unified documentation based on findings
4. **Validation Phase**: Verify the consolidated documentation is accurate and complete

## Components and Interfaces

### Code Analysis Component
- **Purpose**: Analyze Django models, views, URLs, templates, and other Python code
- **Input**: Source code files in the project
- **Output**: Structured data about current implementation
- **Methods**:
  - Model field analysis and relationship mapping
  - View and URL pattern discovery
  - Template and static file inventory
  - Migration history analysis

### Documentation Analysis Component
- **Purpose**: Parse and categorize all existing markdown documentation
- **Input**: All .md files in the project
- **Output**: Categorized documentation with purpose and status
- **Methods**:
  - Content parsing and categorization
  - Change tracking and version identification
  - Cross-reference with code implementation

### Comparison Engine
- **Purpose**: Compare current implementation against original PRD and BuildVerifast specifications
- **Input**: Current state data + original specifications
- **Output**: Gap analysis and implementation status
- **Methods**:
  - Feature mapping and status tracking
  - Requirements coverage analysis
  - Implementation stage identification

### Documentation Generator
- **Purpose**: Create consolidated, authoritative documentation
- **Input**: Analysis results and comparison data
- **Output**: Unified documentation set
- **Methods**:
  - Template-based document generation
  - Status reporting and roadmap creation
  - Configuration and setup documentation

## Data Models

### Project State Model
```python
{
    "models": {
        "model_name": {
            "fields": [...],
            "relationships": [...],
            "methods": [...]
        }
    },
    "views": {
        "view_name": {
            "type": "class_based|function_based",
            "url_patterns": [...],
            "template": "...",
            "functionality": "..."
        }
    },
    "documentation": {
        "file_name": {
            "purpose": "...",
            "status": "current|outdated|implemented",
            "changes_documented": [...]
        }
    },
    "implementation_status": {
        "stage": "1-6",
        "completed_features": [...],
        "missing_features": [...],
        "broken_features": [...]
    }
}
```

### Gap Analysis Model
```python
{
    "missing_requirements": [...],
    "extra_implementations": [...],
    "outdated_documentation": [...],
    "configuration_issues": [...],
    "next_priorities": [...]
}
```

## Error Handling

- **File Access Errors**: Handle missing or inaccessible files gracefully
- **Parse Errors**: Continue processing when individual files have syntax issues
- **Comparison Mismatches**: Document discrepancies without failing the entire process
- **Documentation Generation Errors**: Provide partial results if complete generation fails

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual analysis components with sample code
- Test documentation parsing with various markdown formats
- Test comparison logic with known good/bad examples

### Integration Tests
- Test full audit process on a sample Django project
- Verify generated documentation accuracy
- Test error handling with problematic files

### Validation Tests
- Compare generated documentation against manual review
- Verify all existing functionality is properly documented
- Ensure no critical information is lost in consolidation

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Discovery and Inventory
1. Scan all Python files and extract Django components
2. Inventory all markdown documentation files
3. Analyze database migrations and current schema
4. Document current configuration and dependencies

### Phase 2: Functional Analysis
1. Test all existing URLs and views
2. Verify database connectivity and model functionality
3. Check template rendering and static file serving
4. Identify working vs broken functionality

### Phase 3: Comparison and Gap Analysis
1. Map current implementation to PRD requirements
2. Identify which BuildVerifast stages are complete
3. Document deviations from original specifications
4. Prioritize missing or broken functionality

### Phase 4: Documentation Generation
1. Create consolidated requirements document
2. Generate current technical specification
3. Produce implementation status report
4. Create updated roadmap and next steps

## Output Deliverables

1. **Consolidated Requirements Document**: Single source of truth for what the system should do
2. **Current Technical Specification**: Accurate documentation of how the system currently works
3. **Implementation Status Report**: Clear picture of what's done, what's broken, what's missing
4. **Updated Roadmap**: Prioritized plan for completing the project
5. **Configuration Guide**: Complete setup and deployment documentation
6. **Database Schema Documentation**: Current models, relationships, and migration history
