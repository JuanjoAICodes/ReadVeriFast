# Documentation Synchronization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical need to synchronize VeriFast's documentation with the actual implementation status. The audit revealed major inaccuracies where documentation claims features are "0% implemented" when they are actually "100% complete and functional."

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Establish Single Source of Truth Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer or stakeholder, I want a clear documentation hierarchy with one authoritative main document, so that I know which document contains the current accurate status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need project status THEN there SHALL be one clearly designated main status document
2. WHEN I find multiple documents claiming to be "main" THEN duplicates SHALL be consolidated or clearly marked as secondary
3. WHEN I check documentation timestamps THEN the main document SHALL have clear "last updated" and "current as of" timestamps
4. WHEN I review documentation structure THEN it SHALL follow Kiro documentation standards and hierarchy

### Requirement 2: Eliminate Documentation Duplicates

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to avoid confusion from multiple conflicting documents, so that I can trust the information I'm reading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I find duplicate status documents THEN they SHALL be consolidated into one authoritative source
2. WHEN I see conflicting information THEN the authoritative document SHALL be clearly identified
3. WHEN I check session summaries THEN they SHALL reference the main document rather than creating competing status claims
4. WHEN I review documentation folder THEN there SHALL be clear purpose distinction between all files

### Requirement 3: Implement Proper Timestamping

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to know exactly when documentation was last updated and what the status was at any given moment, so that I can track project progress accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check the main document THEN it SHALL have "Last Updated: [DATE]" and "Status as of: [DATE]" timestamps
2. WHEN I review historical status THEN I SHALL be able to see when each major milestone was reached
3. WHEN I check session summaries THEN they SHALL have clear dates and reference the main document status at that time
4. WHEN I need current status THEN the timestamp SHALL tell me how recent the information is

### Requirement 4: Correct Enhanced XP Economics Status

**User Story:** As a developer or stakeholder, I want accurate documentation that reflects the true implementation status, so that I can make informed decisions about the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the documentation THEN it SHALL accurately state that Enhanced XP Economics System is 100% implemented
2. WHEN I review project status THEN it SHALL show the correct completion percentage (98-100% vs claimed 95%)
3. WHEN I check implementation tasks THEN it SHALL reflect that all 12 XP Economics tasks are complete
4. WHEN I review session summaries THEN they SHALL accurately describe what was actually accomplished vs planned

### Requirement 5: Update API Backend Status

**User Story:** As a developer planning mobile app development, I want accurate API documentation status, so that I know what's available for integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check API status THEN it SHALL correctly show 98% complete (not varying percentages)
2. WHEN I review missing components THEN it SHALL only list Swagger/OpenAPI documentation as missing
3. WHEN I check endpoint status THEN it SHALL show all major endpoints as implemented and tested
4. WHEN I review authentication THEN it SHALL show JWT system as fully functional

### Requirement 6: Correct Platform Completion Status

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want accurate completion metrics, so that I can properly assess project readiness for deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review overall platform status THEN it SHALL show 98-100% complete (not 95%)
2. WHEN I check feature implementation THEN it SHALL show Enhanced XP Economics as complete
3. WHEN I review database status THEN it SHALL show 8 migrations applied (not 5)
4. WHEN I check premium features THEN it SHALL show all features as implemented in code

### Requirement 7: Update Implementation Evidence

**User Story:** As a technical reviewer, I want documentation that includes evidence of implementation, so that I can verify claims against actual code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read feature descriptions THEN they SHALL include references to actual code files
2. WHEN I check model implementations THEN documentation SHALL reference specific migrations
3. WHEN I review API status THEN it SHALL include actual endpoint listings
4. WHEN I check XP system THEN it SHALL reference the 1750+ line implementation file

### Requirement 8: Synchronize Session Summaries

**User Story:** As a team member reviewing project history, I want session summaries that accurately reflect what was discovered vs what was planned, so that I understand the true project timeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read session summaries THEN they SHALL distinguish between "planned to implement" and "discovered already implemented"
2. WHEN I check July 18 session THEN it SHALL show Enhanced XP Economics was discovered complete, not planned
3. WHEN I review task lists THEN they SHALL show completion status based on actual code audit
4. WHEN I check next steps THEN they SHALL reflect documentation sync needs, not feature implementation

### Requirement 9: Update README and Core Documentation

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want the README and core docs to accurately represent the current state, so that I can quickly understand what's built and what needs work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the main README THEN it SHALL show accurate completion percentages
2. WHEN I check feature lists THEN they SHALL mark implemented features as complete
3. WHEN I review architecture docs THEN they SHALL reflect actual database schema
4. WHEN I check quick start guides THEN they SHALL be based on current implementation

### Requirement 10: Implement Kiro Documentation Standards

**User Story:** As a team member using Kiro, I want the documentation to follow Kiro's standards and conventions, so that it integrates properly with the development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check documentation structure THEN it SHALL follow Kiro documentation hierarchy and naming conventions
2. WHEN I review the main document THEN it SHALL be clearly designated as the authoritative source
3. WHEN I check timestamps THEN they SHALL follow Kiro's timestamp format and placement standards
4. WHEN I review file organization THEN it SHALL align with Kiro's documentation best practices

### Requirement 11: Correct Audit Findings Section

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want the audit findings to be prominently displayed, so that everyone understands the documentation was corrected based on actual code review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read documentation THEN it SHALL include a clear "AUDIT FINDINGS" section
2. WHEN I check status updates THEN they SHALL explain the discrepancy between docs and reality
3. WHEN I review corrections THEN they SHALL show before/after status comparisons
4. WHEN I check timestamps THEN they SHALL show when documentation was corrected

## Technical Requirements

### File Update Requirements
- **TR-001:** All documentation files in `/documentation/` directory SHALL be updated
- **TR-002:** Session summary files SHALL be corrected with audit findings
- **TR-003:** README.md SHALL reflect accurate project status
- **TR-004:** Implementation status files SHALL show correct completion percentages

### Consistency Requirements
- **CR-001:** All documentation SHALL use consistent completion percentages
- **CR-002:** Feature status SHALL be consistent across all documentation files
- **CR-003:** API status SHALL be consistently reported as 98% complete
- **CR-004:** Enhanced XP Economics SHALL be consistently shown as 100% implemented

### Evidence Requirements
- **ER-001:** Claims SHALL be backed by references to actual code files
- **ER-002:** Database status SHALL reference actual migration files
- **ER-003:** API status SHALL include actual endpoint verification
- **ER-004:** Feature implementations SHALL reference specific model fields and methods

## Priority Classification

### Critical Priority
- Correct Enhanced XP Economics status (0% → 100%)
- Update overall platform completion (95% → 98-100%)
- Fix session summaries to reflect audit discoveries

### High Priority  
- Update API backend status consistency
- Correct implementation task statuses
- Add audit findings sections

### Medium Priority
- Update architecture documentation
- Sync technical specifications
- Correct development roadmap

## Success Criteria

The documentation synchronization is complete when:
1. All documentation accurately reflects the actual codebase implementation
2. No documentation claims features are unimplemented when they exist in code
3. Completion percentages are consistent and accurate across all files
4. Audit findings are clearly documented with before/after comparisons
5. New developers can rely on documentation to understand actual project status

## Out of Scope

This specification does NOT include:
- Implementing new features
- Modifying existing code functionality
