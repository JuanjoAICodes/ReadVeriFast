# AI-Assisted Code Modification Request

### File(s) to Modify:
- [config/settings.py]
- [config/urls.py]

### Type of Change:
- [Bug Fix]

### Goal:
- [Correctly configure Django's static file handling to restore the admin panel's CSS and JavaScript, ensuring a proper development setup.]

---

### Detailed Instructions:

**1. Correct the Static Files Configuration in `config/settings.py`:**
- We need to define both `STATIC_URL` (where the browser will look for files) and `STATICFILES_DIRS` (where Django's `runserver` will look for your app's static files). We will remove `STATIC_ROOT` for now, as it is only needed for production deployment, not for the development server.
- FIND:
```python
# The entire static files section, including the incorrect STATIC_ROOT
STATIC_URL = 'static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
```
REPLACE WITH:

```python
# This is the standard, correct configuration for local development.
STATIC_URL = 'static/'

# This tells Django where to find your app's static files.
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
]

# STATIC_ROOT is for production deployment only and should be different from STATICFILES_DIRS.
# We will leave it commented out for now to ensure the development server works correctly.
# STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles_prod')
```
**2. Ensure staticfiles is included in the project's urls.py for development:**

Django's development server needs to be explicitly told to serve static files when DEBUG is True. This is a common setup step.

FIND:

```python
# The content of config/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('verifast_app.urls')),
]
```
REPLACE WITH:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from django.conf import settings # <-- NEW IMPORT
from django.conf.urls.static import static # <-- NEW IMPORT

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('verifast_app.urls')),
]

# --- ADD THIS BLOCK ---
# This is a standard pattern to serve static files during development.
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
# NOTE: The above line is a common pattern but can be tricky with runserver.
# A simpler and more robust approach for development is to ensure 'django.contrib.staticfiles'
# is in INSTALLED_APPS and that STATICFILES_DIRS is set correctly. The agent should
# verify this configuration. If the primary fix doesn't work, this url pattern is the next step.
# For now, let's prioritize the settings.py change.
