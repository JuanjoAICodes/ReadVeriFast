# Pydantic Data Validation Requirements

## Introduction

This feature implements Pydantic models for robust data validation, type safety, and API request/response handling in the VeriFast application. The goal is to replace loose dictionary-based data handling with strongly-typed Pydantic models that provide automatic validation, serialization, and better developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: LLM Response Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want LLM API responses to be validated and typed, so that I can catch data inconsistencies early and have better code reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Gemini API returns quiz data THEN the system SHALL validate the response structure using Pydantic models
2. WHEN quiz questions are parsed THEN the system SHALL ensure each question has exactly 4 options and a valid correct answer index
3. WHEN tags are extracted from LLM responses THEN the system SHALL validate the tag list contains 1-7 items
4. IF LLM response validation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and return a safe default
5. WHEN processing article analysis THEN the system SHALL use typed models instead of raw dictionaries

### Requirement 2: API Request Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API endpoints to validate incoming requests, so that invalid data is rejected before processing and users get clear error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users submit article URLs THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format using Pydantic validators
2. WHEN quiz submissions are received THEN the system SHALL validate answer arrays and WPM values
3. WHEN user profile updates are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate all field constraints
4. IF request validation fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 422 with detailed field-level errors
5. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL use Pydantic models for automatic parsing

### Requirement 3: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want application configuration to be validated and typed, so that configuration errors are caught at startup rather than runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate Gemini API configuration using Pydantic models
2. WHEN Celery settings are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate broker URLs and task configurations
3. WHEN XP system parameters are configured THEN the system SHALL validate all numeric constraints
4. IF configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL raise clear startup errors with specific field information
5. WHEN environment variables are processed THEN the system SHALL use Pydantic Settings for type conversion

### Requirement 4: Data Transfer Objects

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent data structures for internal service communication, so that data flows between components are reliable and well-documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services exchange article data THEN the system SHALL use Pydantic models for data transfer
2. WHEN XP calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL use typed models for transaction data
3. WHEN tag analysis is conducted THEN the system SHALL use validated models for analytics data
4. WHEN background tasks process data THEN the system SHALL serialize/deserialize using Pydantic models
5. WHEN data is cached THEN the system SHALL use Pydantic models for consistent serialization

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and helpful error messages when I submit invalid data, so that I can understand what needs to be corrected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide field-specific error messages
2. WHEN multiple validation errors exist THEN the system SHALL return all errors in a structured format
3. WHEN custom validation rules are violated THEN the system SHALL provide contextual error descriptions
4. WHEN API responses contain validation errors THEN the system SHALL format them consistently
5. WHEN debugging validation issues THEN the system SHALL log detailed validation context

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Code

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Pydantic models to integrate seamlessly with existing Django models and DRF serializers, so that the transition is smooth and doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Pydantic models are introduced THEN existing Django models SHALL continue to work unchanged
2. WHEN DRF serializers are used THEN they SHALL coexist with Pydantic models without conflicts
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN Pydantic models SHALL not interfere with Django ORM
4. WHEN API endpoints are updated THEN existing client code SHALL continue to work
5. WHEN tests are run THEN all existing functionality SHALL pass with Pydantic integration
