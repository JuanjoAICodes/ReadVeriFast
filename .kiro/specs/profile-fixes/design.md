# Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes needed for the profile management system and premium store functionality discovered during comprehensive testing. The design focuses on creating a working premium store, centralizing power-up settings, and enabling admin testing capabilities.

## Architecture

### Premium Store Implementation

#### URL Routing
- Add `/premium-store/` URL pattern to main URLconf
- Create dedicated view for premium store functionality
- Implement template for premium feature display and purchasing

#### Store Functionality
- Display available premium features with pricing
- Show user's current XP balance
- Handle purchase transactions with XP deduction
- Provide purchase confirmation and error handling

### Profile Centralization

#### Power-Up Settings Migration
- Move chunking controls from article page to profile
- Move font selection from article page to profile  
- Move smart feature toggles from article page to profile
- Keep only reading speed control on article page

#### Settings Persistence
- Ensure profile settings are saved to database
- Load user preferences on article pages
- Maintain settings across user sessions

### Admin Testing Features

#### Admin Detection
- Identify admin users (superuser status)
- Bypass XP restrictions for admin users
- Enable all premium features for admin accounts

#### Testing Capabilities
- Allow admin users to test purchase flows
- Provide admin-specific UI indicators
- Maintain normal restrictions for regular users

## Components and Interfaces

### Premium Store View
```python
class PremiumStoreView(LoginRequiredMixin, TemplateView):
    template_name = 'verifast_app/premium_store.html'
    
    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        # Load available features and user XP
        # Return context for template rendering
```

### Profile Enhancement
```python
class UserProfileView(LoginRequiredMixin, TemplateView):
    # Add power-up settings to profile context

    # Save preferences to user model
```

### Admin Middleware
```python
def admin_premium_features(user):
    # Check if user is admin
    # Return all premium features enabled
    # Bypass XP restrictions
```
