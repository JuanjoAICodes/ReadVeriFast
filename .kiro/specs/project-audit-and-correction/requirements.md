# Project Audit and Correction Requirements

## Requirement 1: Codebase Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire codebase to be audited and corrected, so that it strictly adheres to all defined project standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.1. The system SHALL analyze every file covered by the patterns in every `.kiro/hooks/*.hook` file.
1.2. WHEN a file does not meet the standards defined in its corresponding hook, THEN the system SHALL correct the file.
1.3. The correction SHALL only apply the minimal viable change required to meet the standard, preserving all existing functionality.
1.4. The entire process, including every file checked, SHALL be documented in a `tasks.md` file.
