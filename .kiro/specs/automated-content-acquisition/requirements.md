# Automated Content Acquisition System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an automated content acquisition system that continuously ingests news articles from multiple sources in both English and Spanish, ensuring content diversity, freshness, and proper language-specific processing while respecting API limits and avoiding redundancy in conten

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Source Content Ingestion

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to automatically acquire news articles from multiple RSS feeds and APIs, so that users have access to fresh, diverse content without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs automated content acquisition THEN it SHALL fetch articles from at least 10 English RSS sources and 8 Spanish RSS sources
2. WHEN acquiring content THEN the system SHALL prioritize NewsData.io API for full article content within commercial use limits
3. WHEN RSS feeds provide only summaries THEN the system SHALL implement secondary scraping using Newspaper3k for full content
4. WHEN API limits are approached THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to alternative sources
5. WHEN a source is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue with other sources without failing

### Requirement 2: Content Diversity and Anti-Redundancy

**User Story:** As a content consumer, I want to see diverse news coverage across different topics and sources, so that I'm not overwhelmed with repetitive content on the same subject.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing articles THEN the system SHALL limit to maximum 4 articles per topic per day per language
2. WHEN multiple articles from the same source are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize source rotation
3. WHEN detecting similar content THEN the system SHALL implement deduplication based on content similarity
4. WHEN acquiring articles THEN the system SHALL ensure geographic diversity when possible
5. WHEN topic saturation occurs THEN the system SHALL prefer articles from underrepresented topics

### Requirement 3: Language-Specific Processing

**User Story:** As a multilingual user, I want articles and quizzes to be processed in their original language, so that the content maintains its authenticity and accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing an article THEN the system SHALL detect and tag the article language (English/Spanish)
2. WHEN generating quizzes THEN the system SHALL send LLM prompts in the same language as the article
3. WHEN storing articles THEN the system SHALL maintain language tags for proper categorization
4. WHEN processing Spanish articles THEN the system SHALL use Spanish prompts for Gemini API calls
5. WHEN processing English articles THEN the system SHALL use English prompts for Gemini API calls

### Requirement 4: Automated Scheduling and Rate Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the content acquisition to run automatically at optimal intervals, so that content stays fresh while respecting API rate limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduling content acquisition THEN the system SHALL run every 4 hours to maintain freshness
2. WHEN using APIs THEN the system SHALL track and respect daily/monthly limits
3. WHEN approaching rate limits THEN the system SHALL adjust acquisition frequency automatically
4. WHEN RSS feeds are processed THEN the system SHALL stagger requests to avoid overwhelming sources
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic

### Requirement 5: Admin Controls and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control and monitor the automated content acquisition, so that I can test, debug, and ensure optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing admin interface THEN the system SHALL provide start/stop controls for automation
2. WHEN monitoring acquisition THEN the system SHALL display real-time status and statistics
3. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL allow manual triggering of content acquisition
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
5. WHEN acquisition completes THEN the system SHALL report success/failure metrics

### Requirement 6: Content Quality and Processing

**User Story:** As a content consumer, I want high-quality articles with proper metadata and quizzes, so that I can learn effectively from diverse, well-processed content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN acquiring articles THEN the system SHALL validate content quality and completeness
2. WHEN processing articles THEN the system SHALL extract proper metadata (title, author, date, source)
3. WHEN generating quizzes THEN the system SHALL create language-appropriate questions
4. WHEN storing content THEN the system SHALL ensure proper database relationships and indexing
5. WHEN content fails processing THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with other articles

### Requirement 7: User Experience Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to discover new articles in my preferred language while having access to content in other languages through tags, so that I can explore diverse perspectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users visit the main page THEN the system SHALL display articles in their selected language
2. WHEN users browse tags THEN the system SHALL show articles in all languages with proper language indicators
3. WHEN new articles are acquired THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing XP and tag systems
4. WHEN users search THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by language and topic
5. WHEN displaying articles THEN the system SHALL show clear language indicators and source attribution
